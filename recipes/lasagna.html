    <h2>Recipe Steps!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
            until cooked through but firm to the bite,
            about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour,
            salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and
            bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture,
            stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce
            and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, 
            zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
            Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture,
            and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering
            2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a
            layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and
            bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
